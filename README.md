# My Developer Environment

This is my personal repo that I store my scripts for a fresh install and also my dotfiles.
Feel free to use these as you wish but understand that they may not be suited to you.

## Usage

- **OS**: [Arch Linux] - I enjoy building my distro from the ground up.
- **Window Manager**: [Hyprland] - I like tilling window managers.
- **Editor**: [Neovim] - I use the LazyVim config. I plan on building my own config when I become more proficient with lua.
- **Terminal** [Ghostty] - My main terminal. I also use Alacritty for launching TUIs from waybar.
- **StatusBar** [Waybar] - I like a simple and clean status bar. 

## Installation

1.) Install Arch and then Hyprland following the wiki pages for each.
2.) Run the run.sh script and then perform the instructions at the end of the script. 
3.) Run the install-dotfiles.sh script.
4.) Adjust the hyprland.conf monitor section and then the hyprpaper.conf file to suit your needs. 
5.) Reboot and Enjoy.

## Issues

This setup is not perfect and is liable to change.
Everything that the run.sh script installs is what i use daily.
